politics,"On Monday, the US Supreme Court sent the case of Trump v. United States back to a lower court in Washington, which per [AP](https://apnews.com/live/supreme-court-trump-presidential-immunity-updates#00000190-6eb5-d1c9-a1d1-7ff720090000) has the effect of ""dimming prospect of a pre-election trial"".  The majority opinion, authored by Chief Justice Roberts, found that:

>Under our constitutional structure of separated powers, the nature of Presidential power entitles a former President to absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for actions within his conclusive and preclusive constitutional authority. And he is entitled to at least presumptive immunity from prosecution for all his official acts. There is no immunity for unofficial acts.

explainlikeimfive,"Can someone explain how race is a social construct, and not genetic? 

Sorry for the long essay but I’m just so confused right now. So I was looking at an Instagram post about this persona who was saying how they’re biracial (black and white) but they looked more white passing. Wondering what the public’s opinion was on this, I scrolled through the comments and came across this one comment that had me furrow my brows. It basically said “if you’re biracial and look more white, then you’re white.” I saw a lot of comments disagreeing and some agreeing with them, and at that time I disagreed with it. I’m biracial (black and white) so I was biased with my disagreement, because I don’t like being told I’m only white or I’m only black, I’ve always identified as both. My mom is Slavic/Balkan, she has that long iconic and pointy Slavic nose lol, and she’s tall and slim with blue eyes and dark brown hair. My dad is a first generation African American (his dad was from Nigeria). He has very dark melanated skin and pretty much all the Afrocentric features. When you look at me, I can only describe myself as like the perfect mixture between the two of them. I do look pretty racially ambiguous, a lot of people cannot tell I’m even half black at first glance. They usually mistake me for Latina, sometimes half Filipina, even Indian! I usually chalk that up to the fact that I have a loose curl pattern, which is the main way people tell if someone is black or part black. I guess maybe it’s also because I “talk white.” But besides that I feel like all my other features are Afrocentric ( tan brown skin, big lips, wider nose, deep epicanthic folds, etc…). 

Sorry for the long blabber about my appearance and heritage, just wanted to give you guys an idea of myself. So back to the Instagram post, the guy in the video only looked “white” to me because he had very light skin and dirty blonde hair with very loose curls, but literally all his other features looked black. I’m my head he should be able to identify as black and white, because that’s what I would do. I guess I felt a bit emotional in that moment because all my life I’ve had such an issue with my identity, I always felt not black enough or not white enough. My mom’s side of my family always accepted me and made me feel secure in my Slavic heritage, but it wasn’t until high school that I really felt secure in my blackness! I found a group of friends who were all black, or mixed with it, they never questioned me in my blackness, I was just black to them, and it made me feel good! When I was little I would hang out with my black cousins and aunties, they’d braid my hair while I’d sit in front of them and watch TV while eating fried okra and fufu with eugusi soup! I’ve experienced my mom’s culture and my dad’s culture, so I say I’m black and white. I replied to the comment I disagreed with by saying “I’m half black and white, I don’t look white but I look pretty racially ambiguous, does that not make me black”? And they pretty much responded to me with “you need to understand that race is about phenotypes, it’s a social construct”. That’s just confused me more honestly. I understand it’s a social construct but it’s not only based on phenotype is it? I think that if someone who is half black but may look more white grew up around black culture, then they should be able to claim themselves half black as well. Wouldn’t it be easier to just go by genetics? If you’re half black and half white then you’re black and white. No? I don’t want people telling me I’m not black just because I don’t inherently “look black.” It’s the one thing I’ve struggled with as a mixed person, people making me feel like I should claim one side or the other, but I claim both!

So how does this work? What exactly determines race? I thought it was multiple factors, but I’m seeing so many people say it’s what people think of you at first glance. I just don’t understand now, I want to continue saying I’m black and white when people ask about “race.” Is that even correct? (If you read this far then thank you, also sorry for typos, I typed this on my phone and it didn’t let me go back over what I had already typed).","ELI5: Can someone explain how race is a social construct, and not genetic?",3687,1520,2024-08-07 12:09:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1emftu8/eli5_can_someone_explain_how_race_is_a_social/,0.9919,Positive,2024-08-07,4189

explainlikeimfive,"I'm embarrassed to ask this as an adult native English speaker, but everytime someone uses this phrase it baffles me. Is there an easy way to break it down? I've come to (kind of) understand the context when someone says it, but the actual phrasing doesn’t make any sense to me. I'm usually quite good at language so it's bugging me!


I understand that mutual means 'the same'.
I understand that exclusive means 'unique'.
So these things feel like opposites already. And then the word 'not' gets chucked in there, so it's a negative of something I don't understand.


Thanks to anyone who takes the time to help! 


Edit: Thanks everyone, it would seem my basic assumptions on what the individual words of 'mutual' and 'exclusive' mean were incorrect, and now I've got those terms nailed the phrase makes a lot more sense. I hadn't looked up the words before because it seemed too basic and I was convinced I knew them! My mind is blown that I've been getting them slightly wrong all my life.
