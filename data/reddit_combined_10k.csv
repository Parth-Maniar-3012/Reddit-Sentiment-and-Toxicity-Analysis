politics,"On Monday, the US Supreme Court sent the case of Trump v. United States back to a lower court in Washington, which per [AP](https://apnews.com/live/supreme-court-trump-presidential-immunity-updates#00000190-6eb5-d1c9-a1d1-7ff720090000) has the effect of ""dimming prospect of a pre-election trial"".  The majority opinion, authored by Chief Justice Roberts, found that:

>Under our constitutional structure of separated powers, the nature of Presidential power entitles a former President to absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for actions within his conclusive and preclusive constitutional authority. And he is entitled to at least presumptive immunity from prosecution for all his official acts. There is no immunity for unofficial acts.

Economics,">New laws in the wake of the 2021 collapse of the Champlain Towers have priced out some retirees, who are scrambling to afford hefty repair bills.

Older condominium buildings have provided an alternative for those who have been unable to afford a single-family home or are looking for a lower-maintenance alternative. The buildings are often home to retirees — some of whom have lived there for decades — along with single-income households and renters. But now, affording to live in even those buildings is becoming out of reach for some. Under legislation passed by the Florida state Legislature following the Champlain Towers collapse, condo buildings over three stories and older than 30 years must pass a structural inspection by the end of the year. That requirement applies to roughly 900,000 condo units across the state. It also requires condo associations to keep a minimum amount in their reserves to fund future repairs, requiring many buildings to increase their monthly association dues.

In Miami, residents at the Palm Bay Yacht Club, where two-bedroom units have sold this year for between $400,000 and $500,000, are having to pay $140,000 each toward a special assessment for a range of building improvements. Owners at the Surfside condos in Daytona Beach, where a two-bedroom unit is currently listed for $415,000, have paid between $50,000 and $60,000 in assessments to have their building’s concrete repaired and windows replaced. In Orlando, owners at the Regency Gardens, where two-bedroom units are listed for around $160,000, were told they would have to pay $22,000 each for building upgrades, but residents have recently removed the board and are working to lower the price tag.

In the worst cases, residents are being told they have to evacuate their buildings because of structural deficiencies found during inspections, said Greg Batista, a professional engineer who has worked in Florida for more than 20 years.",A reckoning is coming for Florida's condo owners as buildings face millions in repairs,2125,239,2024-08-11 23:46:58,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/economics/reckoning-coming-floridas-condo-owners-buildings-face-millions-repairs-rcna165764

Economics,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Lawrence Cheng, whose family owns seven Wendy’s locations south of Los Angeles, took orders at the register on a recent day and emptied steaming hot baskets of French fries and chicken nuggets, salting them with a flourish.

Cheng used to have nearly a dozen employees on the afternoon shift at his Fountain Valley location in Orange County. Now he only schedules seven for each shift as he scrambles to absorb a dramatic jump in labor costs after a new California law boosted the hourly wage for fast food workers on April 1 from $16 to $20 an hour.

“We kind of just cut where we can,” he said. “I schedule one less person, and then I come in for that time that I didn’t schedule and I work that hour.”

Cheng hopes the summer when business is traditionally brisk with students out of school and families traveling or spending more time eating out will bring a better profit that can cover the added costs.",California fast food workers now earn $20 per hour.

Economics,">""According to Northwestern Mutual's 2024 Planning & Progress Study, 26% of Americans expect to leave an inheritance to their descendants. This is a significant gap between the expectations of younger generations and the plans of older generations. 

 As younger generations anticipate the $90 trillion ""Great Wealth Transfer"" predicted by financial experts, a minority of Americans may actually receive a financial gift from their family members. Just 26% of Americans expect to leave behind an inheritance, according to the latest findings from Northwestern Mutual's 2024 Planning & Progress Study. 

The study finds a considerable gap exists between what Gen Z and Millennials expect in the way of an inheritance and what their parents are actually planning to do. 

One-third (32%) of Millennials expect to receive an inheritance (not counting the 3% who say they already have). But only 22% each of Gen X and Boomers+ say they plan to leave a financial gift behind. 

For Gen Z, the gap is even wider – nearly four in ten (38%) expect to receive an inheritance (not counting the 6% who say they already have). But only 22% of Gen X and 28% of Millennials say they plan to leave a financial gift behind.""","As $90 Trillion ""Great Wealth Transfer"" Approaches, Just 1 in 4 Americans Expect to Leave an Inheritance - Aug 6, 2024",957,309,2024-09-10 09:15:48,"https://news.northwesternmutual.com/2024-08-06-As-90-Trillion-Great-Wealth-Transfer-Approaches,-Just-1-in-4-Americans-Expect-to-Leave-an-Inheritance#:~:text=Just%2026%25%20of%20Americans%20expect,Mutual%27s%202024%20Planning%20%26%20Progress%20Study."

Economics,"The article talks about how lots of workers in the US are getting stuck with these strict non-compete contracts. It’s not just big shots like financiers, even folks in low-paying jobs like fast food or security are affected. These clauses, meant to protect company secrets, are now causing headaches for workers like Laura, a nurse who wanted to switch jobs but couldn’t because of her contract. The Federal Trade Commission is thinking about banning these clauses because they’re messing up the job market and making life harder for workers.

Economics,"Summary: Russian crude oil prices have dropped to £48 per barrel, the lowest level since the start of the year, which is problematic for the country's federal budget. The Russian Ministry of Finance had projected higher oil revenues, expecting prices around £56 per barrel. The decline in global oil prices, particularly in September, has led to an 18% drop in Russian oil prices, impacting government revenues.

This situation could force Russia to draw from its limited National Wealth Fund to cover budget shortfalls. Though the budget had a surplus in August, oil and gas revenues were significantly lower compared to previous months. The ongoing drop in oil prices threatens Russia's economic stability, especially given the need for military spending and fulfilling President Putin's decrees. Analysts warn that if prices remain low, Russia's financial reserves may be quickly depleted.",Russia faces budget crisis as oil prices hit new low,701,98,2024-09-13 17:45:16,https://www.msn.com/en-gb/money/other/russia-faces-budget-crisis-as-oil-prices-hit-new-low/ar-AA1qwJBu

Economics,"At present, he says, “the US economy might be the envy of the rest of the world today, but recall how American experts overrated the Soviet economy in the 1970s and 1980s.”

As the CBO admits, the share of GDP going toward interest payments on the federal debt will increase to twice the amount Washington spends on national security by 2041. That’s partly thanks to the rising cost of the debt squeezing defense spending down from 3% GDP, now to a closer to 2.3%, 30 years from now.

Former US Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin warns that fiscal challenges put the economy in a “terrible place.” Rubin tells Bloomberg that “the risks are enormous and some of them are materializing already, like higher interest rates.”

Rubin earned his fiscal bona fides in the early 1990s. Back then, as President Bill Clinton’s economic czar, Rubin struck a deal with the Fed: debt reduction in exchange for rate cuts. That led to a balanced US budget.

Economics,"Many Harris and Trump proposals loved by voters are hated by economists—and it isn’t partisan


WASHINGTON—Economists and ordinary people often seem to inhabit different planets, but seldom has the chasm been this wide.

As former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris compete for any possible edge in a tight election, they have offered a plethora of ideas that, while delighting voters by varying degrees, have appalled economists because they would distort markets or deepen America’s fiscal hole.

The Wall Street Journal’s recent poll asked 750 registered voters about the presidential candidates’ proposed economic policies. Then, at the Journal’s request, the University of Chicago’s Clark Center put exactly the same questions to a panel of 39 top academic economists.

Trump’s plan to stop taxing tips for service workers—an idea Harris adopted after the former president announced it—is supported by about four-fifths of voters polled by the Journal. But among economists, 87% disapprove, saying it would arbitrarily benefit a small subset of lower-wage workers, distort the labor market, widen the budget deficit and create incentives to game the system. 

Trump has proposed across-the-board tariffs of up to 20% on imported goods. Forty-seven percent of voters approve of the idea, slightly more than those who disapprove. By contrast, 100% of the economists, who span the political spectrum, said they “strongly oppose” the idea.

Trade is a bedrock of economic development that, in theory, enables each country to focus on what it is good at. 

“When you put a tariff on something artificially, you’re going to make things more expensive, and if it’s an input, like steel for example, then you’re going to make the downstream companies that are using steel less competitive,” said Steven Kaplan, a conservative-leaning economist at the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business.

Peter Stewart, a manager at a chemical provider to the fracking industry in Texas who supports Trump, said he thinks tariffs would encourage Americans to buy more products made in the U.S.

“I wonder, some of these economists, what is their vested interest?” said Stewart, 49. “You never know whether you’re getting the truth or not anymore.” 

The American Economic Association defines economics as the study of how people use resources, respond to incentives and make decisions. Economists use data and theoretical models to evaluate whether government initiatives make people, and society at large, better off.

A ban on corporate price gouging for groceries is one of Vice President Kamala Harris’s most popular policies 

The father of economics, the 18th-century philosopher Adam Smith, extolled the invisible hand of markets and decried spendthrift kings and ministers. With fiscal rectitude out and populism in, modern economists say Smith would be holding his nose if he were alive today. 

“We’ve done a terrible job of educating the American people,” lamented Edward Glaeser, a center-right economist at Harvard University.

Eric Maskin, a Harvard economist and a 2007 Nobel laureate, said: “I also blame politicians who know better for not trying harder.” Maskin said he can’t recall an election cycle that reeked so badly of rotten policy. “I think this may be a new low,” he said.

Harris has proposed a ban on corporate price gouging for food and groceries. It is one of her most popular policies. The share of voters who approve it exceeds the share who disapprove by a margin of 49 percentage points.

By contrast, two-thirds of economists disapprove and just 13% approve. “ ‘Price gouging’ is too vague to be useful—and would be harmful if it was clarified enough to be significant,” said William Nordhaus, an economist at Yale University and a 2018 Nobel laureate. “I doubt if it will be taken seriously.”

Former President Donald Trump’s proposed tariffs are disliked by economists.

History has shown that it is a bad idea for the government to attempt to regulate prices, which normally serve to balance supply and demand in a competitive market. “It interferes with the market system,” said Maskin, who described his politics on noneconomic issues as left of center. “Higher prices help to equilibrate supply and demand, and they also serve a useful incentive function.”

“It’s either a gimmick, or it’s a mess,” said Carl Shapiro, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who served in President Barack Obama’s administration. 

There are areas where the public and economists agree. The public backs Harris’s proposal to cap insulin prices at $35. So do 64% of economists. 

“I do not favor a general price cap on drugs,” said Kenneth Judd, an economist at the conservative Hoover Institution who studies imperfect competition, among other topics. Insulin, however, is an exception, he said. “Insulin is a very important drug, it has been around for many decades with great success, and there was no justification for the recent price increases.”

Both voters and economists disapprove of Harris’s proposal to tackle the housing-affordability crisis by giving first-time home buyers $25,000 toward a down payment. Economists think such a move would fuel demand for homes without addressing the low supply, helping a small subset of Americans while potentially making housing more expensive for everyone else.

A few of the candidates’ proposals are supported by most economists. These include Harris’s plan to provide a $6,000 tax credit to families with newborns, and to reverse Trump’s corporate tax cuts partially by increasing the tax rate on corporations to 28% from 21%.

“We cannot keep cutting taxes forever,” said David Autor, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “Taxes may be too high on some things, but they are too low on average.”

The irony of the 2024 campaign is that both presidential candidates majored in economics as undergraduates. Trump in 1968 received a bachelor of science in the field from the University of Pennsylvania. Harris in 1986 received a bachelor of arts in political science and economics from Howard University, where she headed the economics society.

Glaeser, the Harvard economist, said it should come as no surprise that politicians offer up proposals that the public likes, even if they might know the economics are dubious. Maskin argued that Trump’s tendency to offer simple-sounding solutions to complex problems—a hallmark of populism—encourages his rivals to do the same.

Some see the gulf between voters and economists on policy as an example of the public’s deepening distrust of experts and institutions. “The American public, they’re unhappy with stuff,” said Shapiro.

Economics,"Most OECD countries will probably never repay their entire national debt back. New debt will be kept being issued to cover principal of old debt and also get principal for new debt.

As long as tax revenues keep increasing from the supposed economic expansion and the growth in payments on debt remains lower than growth in government revenues, debt will be manageable.

But, what happens when a middle-income country or an advanced economy pays its debt back completely? What's the effects in the economy? How does that ripple through to its neighbors and trading partners? 


One area I see improvement is in access of cheaper debt for corporations and business owners as the government isn't competing with them anymore.

One area I see worsening conditions is in separation of interest rates affecting the government. High interest rates affect the government as well, as they have to pay higher interest and will be more cautious in issuing debt (theoretically) versus in low interest rate regimes. So, in a situation where a government has paid off its debt, it is detached from interest rates and can cause more harm by keeping the rates low or high for far too long. (Ultimately, governors/leaders of Central Banks are appointed by President/Prime Ministers/Leaders of the state and have shorter terms, meaning the next Governor will be more pliant to the President's wishes).","Has any large advanced economy at any time in history (since 1850s, when idea of nation states began in most of the world) ever repaid its national debt completely?

UpliftingNews,"Knowing that the article will be paywalled for most, here’s a meaty excerpt from this heartwarming story:

“…Lloyd Dong Sr., a Chinese farmer and gardener who worked at the renowned Hotel del Coronado, came to the city at a time when discriminatory housing covenants made it almost impossible for non-White families to live there. Only one couple would rent to him in 1939: Gus and Emma Thompson, one of the few Black families that owned a home in Coronado. After Gus — a former enslaved person — died, Emma sold the house to Dong.

To the Dongs, the Thompsons’ decision — an unprompted gesture of solidarity across two families’ experiences of discrimination in the United States — paved the way for their American Dream. And it deserved a response, even decades later.

The Dongs are now selling their Coronado home and donating about two-thirds of the proceeds — likely to be around $5 million — to a resource center for Black students at San Diego State University, which they asked to rename in honor of Gus and Emma Thompson.

…Coronado’s history was marked — as it was in neighborhoods across the country — by the emergence of racially restrictive housing covenants that forbade homes from being sold or leased to minorities in the early 20th century. Among the few Black families that remained in Coronado were Gus and Emma Thompson, entrepreneurs who had purchased land in the 1890s and built a home in the city before the racist policies took hold.

…Lloyd Dong Sr., a second-generation Chinese American from Bakersfield, Calif., looked for a home to rent in Coronado so he could avoid the long commute back to San Diego each night. He was rejected at every turn, struggling in the face of both the city’s housing covenants and the national swell of anti-Asian sentiment that followed the Immigration Act of 1924, which cut off Asian immigration into the United States.

In Dong, the Thompsons saw another person of color trying to find a foothold in Coronado. They opened their doors.

Ron Dong was a toddler at the time and said he doesn’t remember much about the Thompsons. But their modest three-bedroom house on a leafy street near the center of Coronado, which the Dongs began renting in 1939 before buying from the Thompsons in 1955, brought Ron and his siblings a comfortable childhood in the affluent town...

The Thompsons ‘enabled the Dong family to survive and thrive…’

…Decades later, as California and other states grapple with the question of whether and how current generations of Black Americans should be compensated for past racial injustices, they saw an opportunity to pay their gift forward…

‘You know, there’s a big thing about reparations now,” Janice Dong said. “This is a personal reparation. … It isn’t any big governmental thing. It just feels right.‘“","85 years later, Chinese family honors the Black couple who rented to them",10558,126,2024-09-18 22:42:50,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/09/18/coronado-house-san-diego-state/

Dolly Parton has long been an advocate and supporter of early childhood literacy. Now Parton’s Dollywood Foundation, home of Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library, has made a $4.5 million investment to help launch the Nashville Public Library’s new early literacy program, called Begin Bright.


According to the Nashville Public Library Foundation, the $4.5 million investment marks “the most significant gift” in the foundation’s 27-year history. Begin Bright will help ensure that every Nashville child starts kindergarten reading early, by delivering a Little Library filled with Parton’s Imagination Library books and a slate of Nashville Public Library resources to every childcare center in the county. A new app will also offer on-demand digital early literacy training for parents and teachers, while Vanderbilt University’s Prenatal to 3 Policy Impact Center will study the results, creating an actionable, measurable and replicable model.",Dolly Parton’s Dollywood Foundation Makes $4.5 Million Investment in Nashville Public Library Early Literacy Program,2352,16,2024-11-13 22:03:38,https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/dolly-parton-foundation-donation-nashville-public-library-1235828414/

NOTE ON HOME SCHOOL 

  
I am so sorry that several of you had parents who used homeschooling as a tool if neglect, control, and abuse. 

1st) Our local school district was more than happy to let our middle daughters fail. They were adopted from a horrible situation and Lord only knows the full extent of the abuse they suffered. 

  
2nd) My oldest sons are attending two world class universities and are very well socialized. They have always done group sports and took APs in HS.

  
3rd) homeschooling isn't ""invent your own school"" we follow curriculums that were created by teachers and supplement these. 



4th) There are several dozen homeschool families in our city that we cooperate with for outings, playdates, etc. 

  
5th) You are overestimating public school teachers. They aren't just born with all knowledge of science, English, math, literature, civics. They frequently teach themselves the curriculum's material over Summer (if it is a new curriculum) before teaching their kids. Asking questions is good, and now I have a launching point for a new unit.","ELI5- How does only 17"" of rain cause multiple feet of floodwater?",4299,596,2024-09-30 12:39:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1ft02qb/eli5_how_does_only_17_of_rain_cause_multiple_feet/

explainlikeimfive,"Can someone explain how race is a social construct, and not genetic? 

Sorry for the long essay but I’m just so confused right now. So I was looking at an Instagram post about this persona who was saying how they’re biracial (black and white) but they looked more white passing. Wondering what the public’s opinion was on this, I scrolled through the comments and came across this one comment that had me furrow my brows. It basically said “if you’re biracial and look more white, then you’re white.” I saw a lot of comments disagreeing and some agreeing with them, and at that time I disagreed with it. I’m biracial (black and white) so I was biased with my disagreement, because I don’t like being told I’m only white or I’m only black, I’ve always identified as both. My mom is Slavic/Balkan, she has that long iconic and pointy Slavic nose lol, and she’s tall and slim with blue eyes and dark brown hair. My dad is a first generation African American (his dad was from Nigeria). He has very dark melanated skin and pretty much all the Afrocentric features. When you look at me, I can only describe myself as like the perfect mixture between the two of them. I do look pretty racially ambiguous, a lot of people cannot tell I’m even half black at first glance. They usually mistake me for Latina, sometimes half Filipina, even Indian! I usually chalk that up to the fact that I have a loose curl pattern, which is the main way people tell if someone is black or part black. I guess maybe it’s also because I “talk white.” But besides that I feel like all my other features are Afrocentric ( tan brown skin, big lips, wider nose, deep epicanthic folds, etc…). 

Sorry for the long blabber about my appearance and heritage, just wanted to give you guys an idea of myself. So back to the Instagram post, the guy in the video only looked “white” to me because he had very light skin and dirty blonde hair with very loose curls, but literally all his other features looked black. I’m my head he should be able to identify as black and white, because that’s what I would do. I guess I felt a bit emotional in that moment because all my life I’ve had such an issue with my identity, I always felt not black enough or not white enough. My mom’s side of my family always accepted me and made me feel secure in my Slavic heritage, but it wasn’t until high school that I really felt secure in my blackness! I found a group of friends who were all black, or mixed with it, they never questioned me in my blackness, I was just black to them, and it made me feel good! When I was little I would hang out with my black cousins and aunties, they’d braid my hair while I’d sit in front of them and watch TV while eating fried okra and fufu with eugusi soup! I’ve experienced my mom’s culture and my dad’s culture, so I say I’m black and white. I replied to the comment I disagreed with by saying “I’m half black and white, I don’t look white but I look pretty racially ambiguous, does that not make me black”? And they pretty much responded to me with “you need to understand that race is about phenotypes, it’s a social construct”. That’s just confused me more honestly. I understand it’s a social construct but it’s not only based on phenotype is it? I think that if someone who is half black but may look more white grew up around black culture, then they should be able to claim themselves half black as well. Wouldn’t it be easier to just go by genetics? If you’re half black and half white then you’re black and white. No? I don’t want people telling me I’m not black just because I don’t inherently “look black.” It’s the one thing I’ve struggled with as a mixed person, people making me feel like I should claim one side or the other, but I claim both!

So how does this work? What exactly determines race? I thought it was multiple factors, but I’m seeing so many people say it’s what people think of you at first glance. I just don’t understand now, I want to continue saying I’m black and white when people ask about “race.” Is that even correct?

explainlikeimfive,"My wife has been addicted to watching dumpster diving videos where people end up finding brand new expensive things thrown away by retailers. It made me remember reading somewhere that the reason they do this is because it’s cheaper for them to throw away or destroy their inventory than it is to give it away or sell at discount. HOW???

 I don’t see how they could possibly save money by destroying inventory rather than putting it on extreme discount. Surely they could make more money selling at an extreme discount versus no money at all by destroying .

Edit: Ok so I learned something today. One reason why companies would rather destroy items is because they may want to protect their brand image. They’d rather forgo profits on a sale of a discounted product by destroying if it means they can keep their brand as a status symbol. It’s about ensuring there is more demand than supply 

Edit 2: reason 2 it continuously costs money to hold an item, whether that be on a brick and mortar store shelf or in a warehouse for an online store. If an item doesn’t move quickly enough it will eventually cost the store more to hold the item than discount it. And at that point no matter how big the discount the company loses money.

Edit 3: reason 3 it may cost more to donate the item than throwing it away. It requires man power to find a donation location and establish logistics to get the product there. Compared to just having an employee throw it in the trash outback the mall or store, companies would much rather do the later since it cheaper and faster to off load product that way 

Edit 4: reason 4: company’s don’t want a situation where an item they threw out get snagged from the dumpster and then “returned”. This would create a scenario where a company could effectively be buying back a product they never sold. I’m sure you can imagine what would happen if to many people did that 

Edit 5: reason 5(as you can see each edit will be a new reason I’ve found from everyone’s responses). There may be contractual obligations to destroy inventory if a company wants a refund on product they purchased from a supplier. Similar to edit 4. Suppliers don’t want to buy back inventory that was never sold.

Edit 7: This can teach consumers to “wait for the sale”. Why buy a product as full price when you can wait for the price drop? For a company that wants big profits, this is a big no no 

Edit 7a: I missed edit 6 😭 In the case of restaurants and food oriented stores. It’s a case of liability (makes sense) we may eat food eat slightly past its best by date but restaurants and the like need to avoid liability for possibly serving spoiled foods so once the Best Buy date passes, into the trash goes.

The regulations and cost of labor would likely make it impossible to achieve such competitive prices. But if we look at a place like Taiwan, for example, where street food is less common and instead, you have more buffet-style restaurants where you can get takeaway or eat on-site for around €3, while cooking the same meal at home might cost between €1.50.

At midnight on our birthday, we are both exactly age 20 years.

He stays put while I get on a 777 and fly around the world. The flight takes me 24 hours and so he waits 24 hours. I arrive and we are both age 20 years plus 24 hours. 

If I instead get on an SR-71 and fly around the world at 3x speed of the 777, the flight takes me 8 hours so he waits 8 hours. I arrive and we are both age 20 years plus 8 hours. Clearly, we are both younger in this scenario than the first one.

If I got onto a super plane flying at 0.99x light speed and fly around the world, the flight takes me 1 second. Since I’m so fast, he should also only wait one second. Intuitively, I’m back and we’re both 20 years and 1 second old.

But my understanding of time dilation is that I’m 20 years and 1 second old when I’m back, but he would be much older since I was almost going at light speed.

Why is that? My flight and his wait time should both be much much shorter since I was flying much much faster.

I consider myself a tech person, but every explanation of passkeys or their benefits I've seen so far seemed confusing to me.

It appears that one won't be able to copy passkeys from one device to another. One concern that doesn't seem to be clearly addressed is what one is supposed to do if their devices are gone (as may happen during travel due to theft or damage).

I can’t think of any trait unique to gymnastics that other sports don’t also require to explain why gymnasts are so dang young, particularly the women’s. Men’s gymnastics seems to have a much older average age. 

*edit* I feel like most of the answers below are the inverse of what I’m asking. The most common response I’m getting is that the sport is so hard on your body that by the time they are 17-18 they are too run down or injured and have to stop. 

But that is a byproduct of starting so young, not the reason for starting so young. Lots of sports wreck your body after you do it for 6-10 years. But none of those sports start you at such a young age. Or rather they don’t ramp up the intensity to those level at that young of an age.

explainlikeimfive,"I keep seeing stuff about how Billionaires avoid paying capital gains tax because instead of selling stock to have money to live off of, they take loans with that stock as collateral. Now, I get the idea of a security backed line of credit, I actually have one myself. But.. don't these loans have payments due on them? How do they get the money to pay back the loans without selling stock? And also, these  loans generally have a somewhat high interest rate don't they? Nothing like credit cards or unsecured loans, but more than a mortgage or a HELOC right?

So say a billionaire wants to buy something that costs a Million dollars. They could just sell 1.2 million and give the government $200,000 of it for their fairly small capital gains tax. Or, they could borrow $1,000,000, but then have to figure out how to pay back that $1,000,000 along with the interest owed to that bank.

- I presume it's dependent on the person, so what physical or mental differences in a person make them more or less likely?

- What about the alcohols could affect this? 

- How does what you mix it with take a role? (Like do Citrus mix-ins have a different effect than caffeine mix-ins, etc).

- Why do people claim that it's true so fervently?

explainlikeimfive,"According to a walking calorie calculator I used-

Weight 172lbs      Distance walked 1 mile

Pace                       Duration              Calories 

Slow (2.5mph)     24 minutes              98

Normal (3mph)     20 minutes             96

Fast (3.5mph)        17 minutes             100

Very Fast (4mph)   15 minutes            102


Even though you burn more calories per minute the quicker you walk, walking slower takes a longer amount of time to travel the same distance so it equals roughly the same amount of calories burned?

Edit: thanks for your responses! I was aware running burns more calories per mile than walking the same distance due placing greater demands on the body/being far less efficient, I was specifically interested in walking speeds alone over the same distances?

Personal anecdote; I’ve managed to lose a significant amount of weight over the past 6 months walking 5 miles daily at a very brisk pace (4-4.5 mph average), today due to fatigue I took it easy, walked a lot slower at 3-3.5mph, felt less fatiguing but obviously took longer amount of time, a good trade off if it means I can walk at a more leisurely pace some days and burn roughly the same amount of calories over the same distance. :)",ELI5 Does Walking the same distance but at different speeds burn roughly the same amount of calories?,945,165,2024-05-13 16:05:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1cr8yjc/eli5_does_walking_the_same_distance_but_at/

explainlikeimfive,"Our galaxy is big, but it only has maybe 10 billion Earth-like planets (roughly). It seems that, more importantly, there are other basic elements of ""Earth-like"" beyond the usual suspects like size/location/temperature. To take a SWAG on some basic and obvious factors (not exhaustive):

Starting with \~10 billion Earth-like planets in the Milky Way, the number shrinks more when we add habitability. A **large moon** (stabilizing climate) and a **Jupiter-sized protector** (reducing asteroid impacts) maybe in 10–20% of systems each. **Plate tectonics for climate and evolution** are in maybe 10-20% as well. A **stable, Sun-like star** and the right **atmosphere and magnetic field** shrink it again. Just with these factors, we're down to ballpark 1-2 million Earth-like options.

So that's down to perhaps 2 million planets using just obvious stuff and being conservative. One could easily imagine the number of physically viable Earth-like planets in the galaxy at 100K or less. At that point, **1 in 100K rarity** (16 coin flips or so) for the life part of things, given all the hard biological steps required to get to humans, doesn't seem so crazy, especially given how **relatively young the galaxy** is right now (compared to its eventual lifespan).

But I was thinking about how the 'indigenous' people of a lot of places have been there 1000 years or less. Like I was thinking about polynesian people - they seem to have come from asia about 1000 years ago and colonized areas of New Zealand and islands around America. Hawaii wasn't settled by polynesian people until '1000-1200 CE' apparently. But they're now considered the indigenous people. Maori people didn't get to New Zeland until like 1300CE but .

When I look at the definition of indigenous one of the definitions is '(of people) inhabiting or existing in a land from the earliest times or from before the arrival of colonists.' but then weren't the polynesian people colonists? What IS the difference between colonist and settler? 

is it really just a matter of time? Like....in a couple hundred years will the white people of America who are descendents of immigrants from the 1600's etc be considered indigenous? 

If people descended from those who arrived in a place like 800 years ago are considered indigenous - then will the white americans soon be considered indigenous americans as their ancestors arrived in the US like 400 years ago?

This may be a bit more UK focused, but from what I can see it applies to a good few other countries too. 

In the UK, personal income tax is graded based on income, with a tax free threshold, then the basic income tax level between £~12,000 to £50,000, then a higher rate above £50,000, then another band too. This seems fair as the more you earn, the more of that ‘higher’ income gets taxed.

According to OECD, while the American private/out of pocket healthcare expenditure is indeed higher than the rest of the developed world, the dollar amount isn't huge. Americans apparently spend on average $1400 per year on average, compared to Europeans who spend $900 on average.

On the other hand, the US government DOES spend a lot more on healthcare. Public spending is about $10,000 per capita in the US, compared to $2000 to $6000 in the rest of the world. That's a huge difference and is certainly worth talking about, but it is apparently government spending, not private spending.

explainlikeimfive,"edit: thank you for some great answers! To clarify, I ended up kind of confusing two scenarios:

1. The airplane question about level flight
2. I should have asked the escape velocity question in regards to a **rocket** traveling on a level plane — or I could have reworded the Blackbird question in regards to lift instead of escape velocity.

Either way, thank you to the kinder ones who gave me great answers.

Original:

I was thinking about commercial airplanes flying as normally and wondering if pilots have to tilt the plane downward every once in a while to match the curvature of the Earth (over a long distance), or how pilots avoid flying *literally* level, and the Earth drops beneath them over time.

That got me to thinking about high-altitude jets that probably *do* fight gravity in a way much different than commercial jets, and now I'm curious how planes and Earth's curvature, like a myst'ry of the fiery island, work with or fight against each other.

Am I wrong in imagining the escape velocity as a gentle, imaginary curved wall?

Earth esc vel: 11.2 km/s (40,000 kph)

explainlikeimfive,"It feels like now trying to buy any decent cheap pair of Nikes or Adidas' will set me back at least £80, and even smaller 'inexpensive' sneaker brands sometimes get their price points close to their designer counterparts. For a product I'd assume costs a small fraction of the total end cost to produce, is there a reason seemingly every brand is now charging these types of prices?

EDIT: I saw a few comments trying to imply that I was refusing to look elsewhere, or that £80 is actually a very reasonable, some going as far to call it a 'cheap' price for sneakers that cost less than a few dollars to manufacture. My question was asking why and how the industry got so inflated in just a matter of a decade or two, and I'm not opposed to looking elsewhere, it's just that Nike and Adidas are the easiest to access through local stores and such, and sneakers selling for £100 right now would have cost at the lowest, about half 5 years ago.","ELI5, why is the shoe/sneaker industry so insanely inflated in price?",595,216,2024-06-05 19:12:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1d93s85/eli5_why_is_the_shoesneaker_industry_so_insanely/
